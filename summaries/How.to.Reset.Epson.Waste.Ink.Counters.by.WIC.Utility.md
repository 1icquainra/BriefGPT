WIC Reset Utility is a tool that allows you to check and reset the waste ink counters of your Epson printer. Waste ink counters are the numbers that show how much ink is used for cleaning and maintenance of the print head. When these counters reach a certain limit, the printer stops working and displays an error message.
 
Resetting the waste ink counters can help you to extend the life of your printer and avoid unnecessary service costs. However, you should also replace or clean the ink pads or use an external waste ink tank to prevent ink leakage.
