He receives a message from the king of Meluha, a powerful and prosperous empire in the Indus Valley, inviting him to join them. Shiva decides to accept the offer, hoping for a better future for his people. He travels to Meluha with his friend and advisor Veer Bhadra, and meets Nandi, the captain of the Meluhan army.
 
Shiva learns that the Meluhans are followers of Lord Ram, who established an ideal society called Ram Rajya thousands of years ago. The Meluhans have a secret medicine called Somras, which gives them long life and good health. However, they are also facing a grave threat from the Chandravanshis, a neighboring kingdom that is allied with the Nagas, a deformed and mysterious race of people with extraordinary powers.
 
The Meluhans believe that Shiva is the Neelkanth, the prophesied savior who will destroy the evil and restore harmony in the land. Shiva is skeptical at first, but he agrees to help them after witnessing their suffering and injustice.
